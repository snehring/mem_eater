#mem_eater
A simple program to use all memory on a system.

##Why?
There is a machine at my place of work with a very large amount of memory. This machine seems to get angry when all of that memory is actually used.
This program exists to test this behavior.

##Future Plans
Make user tunable along with the byte pattern written to memory. Will probably also add a function to verify writes.
